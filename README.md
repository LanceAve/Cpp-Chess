# Cpp-Chess

A terminal-based chess engine built in C++.  
This project is a hands-on exploration of data structure modeling, algorithm design, and rule-based game logic.

## Project Goals

- [ ] Develop core data structures to model chess pieces and board state
- [ ] Implement a human-vs-human chess game with full rule compliance (castling, en passant, promotion, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate a graphical UI (OpenGL, SDL2, or similar)
- [ ] Extend with AI using minimax search and evaluation heuristics
- [ ] (Optional) Explore machine learning or reinforcement learning for self-play

## Status

This project is under active development.  
The foundational architecture—pieces, squares, board logic—is complete.  
Next focus: implementing move validation and game loop control.

# Cpp-Chess

A terminal-based chess game built in C++.  
This project is a hands-on exercise in data structure modeling, search algorithms, and game logic design.

## Goals

- [ ] Learn core data structures and algorithm design through chess implementation
- [ ] Build a working human-vs-human chess engine with full rule support
- [ ] Explore graphical UI using OpenGL, SDL2, or similar
- [ ] (Eventually) implement basic AI using minimax and evaluation heuristics
- [ ] (Optional) Explore machine learning or reinforcement learning as future extension

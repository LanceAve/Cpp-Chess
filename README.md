# Cpp-Chess

A terminal-based chess engine built in C++.  
This project serves as a hands-on exploration of data structure modeling, algorithm design, and game logic implementation.

## Goals

- [ ] Develop core data structures to model chess pieces and board state
- [ ] Implement a human-vs-human chess game with full rule compliance (castling, en passant, etc.)
- [ ] Experiment with graphical UI using OpenGL, SDL2, or similar
- [ ] Extend with AI using minimax and evaluation heuristics
- [ ] (Optional) Explore ML or reinforcement learning for self-play

## Work in Progress

This project is currently under active development.  
Core architecture is being implemented (pieces, squares, board representation). Move generation and game loop logic are next.
